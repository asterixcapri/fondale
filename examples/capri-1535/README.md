# Capri 1535 Example

This is a self-contained consumer of the packaged `@asterixcapri/fondale`
library. From this directory:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:5173>.

The committed tarball under `vendor/` stands in for the npm registry while the
library is developed in the same repository. It contains the same installable
artifact an external project consumes. To refresh it from the Fondale project:

```sh
npm pack --pack-destination examples/capri-1535/vendor
node examples/capri-1535/tools/sync-package-lock.mjs
```

This project owns its source, runtime media, production art, tools, tests,
dependencies, and generated output. Runtime media live beside the source module
that owns them; `src/assets/` is reserved for media genuinely shared by multiple
modules. The `art/` directory contains only source masters and their prompt or
provenance notes; tools write processed game assets directly beside their owning
modules under `src/`.

The bidirectional route is
`alley ↔ town square ↔ harbour ↔ grotto ↔ Monte Solaro`, with the optional
`harbour ↔ tavern` detour. The harbour puzzle unlocks the boat; every Scene uses
Fondale 1.1 Nouns, Commands, directional Passages, and persistent state.
